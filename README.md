[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/raphbacher/OOPExamples/master?filepath=home%2Fjovyan%2FTestTableaux.ipynb)

A [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) compatible repository to try out the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) kernel through a browser. Depending on if the docker image is already built, spawning the notebook may take some time and so please be patient with it.

Meet the requirements for using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to play around with the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava).
